# Booster Dashboard

Small dashboard to show github project metrics.

### General Notes

-   I am using emotion for styling, and although this library provide a package exclusive for react (@emotion/react), I do not like using libraries that do not work standalone. Hence, I decided to use @emotion/css
-   Bootstrap is fetched through CDN rather than npm, promoting smaller bundle size and faster load times due to browser caching
